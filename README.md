Payment Gateway Integration


A simple Responsive website where payment gateway is integrated. 💯💯

There will be a simple donate button on the homepage. On clicking the donate button,
the user will land on the payment page where the user can select the choice of a gateway 
than the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc. 💯

Once the payment is done an invoice will be generated and an email will be sent to the user
for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount. 🎱🎱
